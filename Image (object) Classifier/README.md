The project uses manually collected data for five distinct objects, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset. Subsequently, experiments with multiple iterations of popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as VGG16 and ResNet. The iterative process involved fine-tuning hyperparameters, adjusting network depths, and leveraging transfer learning techniques to capitalize on the pre-trained model's knowledge.
