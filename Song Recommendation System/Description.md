This project aims to develop a song recommendation and classification system based on the number of streams and cluster songs according to various attributes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality, accounting for outliers and variable correlations. For clustering, K-means clustering is applied to both the reduced and original datasets to segment songs into four distinct groups, identifying key attributes and characteristics. Hierarchical clustering with the 'ward' and 'complete' linkage methods is also employed to determine the most effective clustering technique. Additionally, supervised machine learning models, including Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Elastic Net Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks, are utilized to enhance the recommendation and classification accuracy.
