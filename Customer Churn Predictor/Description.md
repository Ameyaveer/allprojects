The project uses both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.
K-means clustering is used to segment bank customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behavior patterns. This segmentation allowed for targeted marketing strategies and personalized services tailored to each customer segment.
To identify the best classification model for predicting customer churn, experimented with various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc. Also performed hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation techniques to fine-tune the models and maximize their predictive performance.
Finally, created a front-end user interface using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for stakeholders and end-users to interact with the model without the need for coding expertise.
